//Create Sharpie class
//We should know about each sharpie their color (which should be a string),
// width (which will be a floating point number), inkAmount (another floating point number)
////When creating one, we need to specify the color and the width
//Every sharpie is created with a default 100 as inkAmount
//We can use() the sharpie objects
//which decreases inkAmount
